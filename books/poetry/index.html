        RL has been writing poetry for several years. The newer poems tend to be better and fit the author's writing style much better. Every book of poetry that this author has written is published and archived here as to leave any lasting imprint if people may find it useful. In a few words, RL's writing style as time progressed falls more in line with beauty. Some write poems that serve to instruct, some to send a message or raise awareness of a certain issue. None of those really were the main focus on writing. At the start, poetry was just a way to let out emotions during a time where every problem felt as a massive weight that was unliftable without writing. Over time this evolved into trying to create beautiful pieces of text. All sorts of linguistic methods are used to create poems that (in the author's eyes) capture a specific instance of something in writing. The titles stand out as being vaguely related to the subject matter, or sometimes not quite at all. In the eyes of the author, there's nothing here that would imply that these poems do anything unique or entirely new, but the connection the author has to the poems is unique and hopefully new. They are there because RL believes that the poems are worth keeping around, and hopes that others may be able to find a use for them as RL has.

    <p style="border-color: crimson; display:flex">Title: The Girl in Red<br>Written: October 2016 - February 2019<br>Published: November 21, 2022<br><br>RL's first book of poetry. Right from the very start it is very clear that this served as the jumping off point for RL's venture into poetry. This book is here because it serves the role of archiving past writing more so than it actually being good.<br><br>The Girl in Red is a single-volume work that encompasses poems written with a very poor state of mind, a youth trying to get points across that did not have a worthwhile avenue just yet. Much of the book will come across bitter to the senses, and they served to build the linguistic structure RL uses in Oswald, Snow Journey. This book is not quite one that most people should be expected to enjoy, and it's recommended that people start with the next book of poetry by RL as the jumping off point. Most things do not have perfect beginnings. The Girl in Red is an example of this.<br><br>If one decides to read it, don't expect much that's life changing. Much of it is bitter to the senses, but it is occasionally useful for reflecting on one's past.

        Title: Oswald, Snow Journey<br>Written: February 2019 - Present<br>Published: November 21, 2022<br><br>The second poetry book written by RL. It is still being written, with the first two volumes published here. <br><br>This multi-volume poetic work encompasses the modern work that characterizes RL in poetry. There are lingering poems that feel as though they've come out of the previous book, but those have largely gone away. The shift from The Girl in Red to Oswald, Snow Journey is one that displays a shift from using poetry to deal with emotions to using poetry as a way to capture emotions and make something that could last.<br><br>Oswald, Snow Journey is when poem ideas began to come more frequently as they were not based on ways to overcome emotional barriers, but became the greater embodiment of the little ideas that came and went throughout the days. The infrequent poems that are used to deal with emotions also fit in better with RL's modern style of writing, and tend to be better at hiding the true meaning behind what the poems are actually saying. Then again, some poems aren't meant to have meaning at all, and purely land in that pool of 'beautiful' poems written for no reason but to look good and make the reader feel something poorly defined.

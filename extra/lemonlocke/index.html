    <p style="border-color: lime;">
        In Pokemon Platinum, RL in the past felt that the rival battles were overly difficult due to level differences. Most people
        would level up their starter or try to switch something up in order to not get ripped apart by Barry's Prinplup. RL felt like
        the best thing to do would be to try and catch Pokemon in the surrounding areas until the team could withstand whatever the rival
        threw at them. The idea behind Lemonlocke as a challenge came from the difficulties surrounding those rival fights. RL never
        really liked the Nuzlocke rule of "if your Pokemon faints, then it is gone forever" because it just felt like tediousness for no
        good reason. A Lemonlocke doesn't have a real punishment for a loss, just more so is like a puzzle to figure out. However,
        the idea for a Hardcore Lemonlocke (see below) allows for higher stakes and more dynamic experiences. Here is an example
        of how RL <a id="linktype" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh1lYLl7Zf0">completed the Elite Four</a> in Pokemon White.
        Rules and cheat codes are listed below. More codes to come for other games in the series.

        <br><br>
        There is also a <a id="linktype" href="./strategies.html">page for strategies</a> for completed runs.

    <p style="border-color: snow;">
        Lemonlocke rules (updated 1/4/2026):<br>
        0 exp multiplier (done with a cheat code), set mode, catch one Pokemon per area (based on met location). No rng manipulation
        or extreme lucky strategies (including Hidden Power, ohko moves, evasion boosting or accuracy lowering moves/abilities/items),
        extra games/consoles/equipment, day care, items in battle (except held items),
        Rare Candies from Pickup or any Rare Candy that has already been collected (Hidden Grottoes, trainer rematches, etc.),
        or saving midway through Elite Four. Keep in mind that Rare Candies are allowed. Also, buying vitamins was generally not
        done when RL was testing this challenge, but it's not explicitly banned.
        <br><br>
        Hardcore ("Delicious") Lemonlocke rules:<br>
        This challenge is mostly the same, except that lucky strategies are allowed but a white out
        ends the run. Also, since white outs end the run, resetting the game
        should not be done during battle/encounter (including when noticed by a trainer).
        This ruleset is more suitable for races, randomizers, and speedruns.

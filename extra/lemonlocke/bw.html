        Text wall:<br><br>
        Starter- picked tepig cause highest attack<br>
        Cress- get pansage from dreamyard and stick it out with your starter and route 1 mon. route 2 mon is probably a high level lillipup. my strategy was to use leer 3x, tackle twice, and then clean up with pansage (since pansage speed ties lillipup probably). previously, unburden purrloin is useful with oran berry to get off a growl (this is banned cause dreamyard x2).<br>
        Lenora- catch roggenrola in wellspring cave (STURDY IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED). catch timburr since throh/sawk is hard to get. rock smash timburr/roggenrolla to weaken the team members and just dish out enough damage mainly.<br>
        Burgh- lower whirlipede def with rock smash/leer and 2hko with darumaka. set up on dwebble with rock throw tumburr. ohko leavanny with darumaka. Eviolite is also in castelia but it was forgotten lol so burgh-clay was probably harder than it needed to be.<br>
        GET SMOKE BALL FROM TEAM PLASMA HIDEOUT PLEASE<br>
        Route 4 Cheren- lead darumaka, kill pidove. take out dewott by switching in useless pokemon, thief simisage and retaliate timburr clean up. chesto rest harden roggenrolla cleans up rest of the team because sandstorm.<br>
        Elesa - Catch a sandile with intimidate (and not minus speed) and grab the plume fossil from relic castle and reset in front of the fossil lady until your archen is plus attack. then grab rock tomb (desert resort), dig (route 4). For the battle have sandile lead with rock tomb to lower speed then have archen knock out the emolga when it can come in safely. Rinse and repeat for the other emolga and then swap between sandile and archen until the zebstrika has its attack severely lowered. then clean up using dig sandile.<br>
        Route 5 Cheren- Paralyze the dewott if you can with twave.<br>
        Clay- Catch a swadloon from route 6 and a timburr from cold storage. The base movesets are fine, and so the strategy is to KO the krokorok with swadloon's stabs, use other mons to lower excadrill's speed and health enough so that archen can finish it off with dig (careful not to let it heal), then kill off palpitoad with razor leaf.<br>
        Skyla- Catch a zebstrika from route 7. give it volt switch as a second stab to compliment its coverage. Use archen/sandile for intimidate and rock tomb, use a klink from chargestone cave for volt switch and defensive utility. Spam electric moves from zebstrika. ohko swanna.<br>
        Twist mountain Cheren- Kill unfezant with zebstrika, paralyze the dewott with klink and finish it with swadloon, weaken simisear with zebstrika and the rest of the team but save timburr to handle the liepard. Make sure you have sandile alive to deal with doctor hank on twist mountain if you aren't going to heal.<br>
        Brycen- Catch a gurdurr from twist mountain and give it substitute and brick break. Lead zebstrika and paralyze the vanillish. From there get a mon killed so you can get gurdurr in for free. Substitute until full para and take out vanillish and a big chunk from beartic. From then you can paralyze cryogonal with zebstrika's thunder wave and then use your remaining mons to take it out.<br>
        Route 8 Bianca- Catch Cobalion in Mistralton Cave (Guidance Chamber) and teach it x scissor. Set up to +3 attack vs the stoutland then sweep bianca's whole team.<br>
        Iris/Drayden- Catch a stunfisk on route 9 for later and catch the static encounter amoonguss in route 10 for an easier time in the next battle (before beating the gym). Set up with work up against the fraxure then finish off the rest of the team.<br>
        Route 10 Cheren- Take out unfezant with zebstrika or stunfisk then get simisear paralyzed and low enough that cobalion can finish the job. Amoonguss is there for the samurott.<br><br>

        Pokemon league- Catch a level 42 durant (with swarm ability and not minus attack) using repels with cobalion in the lead slot, then catch terrakion in the trial chamber. get protect from professor juniper. make sure you have the rocky helmet from cold storage. reteach shell smash on crustle and torment on sandile. if necessary, you can go back and get silverpowder from pinwheel forest (or expert belt) to get better damage ranges vs caitlin.<br>
        Shauntal- Lead durant, spam substitute on cofagrigus and use blackglasses crunch to take it out with substitute still up (a bit rng dependent but whatever). thunder wave the chandelure, then immediately switch to crustle. get some chip damage then let terrakion spam substitute until it can fire off a +1 rock slide. let golurk kill terrakion probably then double intimidate by doing sandile, cobalion, sandile. amoonguss takes out the golurk. switch in cobalion on the shadow ball to thunder wave the jellicent. get chip damage with amoonguss and durant until it perishes.<br>
        Grimsley- Lead terrakion and 2hko the scrafty with sacred sword. let it go down to the krookodile then double intimidate it by sacking sandile and crustle. then use amoonguss to take it down with giga drain. liepard takes out amoonguss then use the rest of your team to take out liepard and bisharp.<br>
        Caitlin- Get reuniclus to low enough where it will heal in front of a fully healthy crustle. Use shell smash twice as reuniclus heals then attacks you. Clean up the rest of the team as long as you can hit a rock slide.<br>
        Marshal- lead amoonguss and toxic the throh. protect, switch to terrakion, then sub and then let it die from your attack plus toxic damage. sawk comes out on durant, thunder wave it, then switch to crustle to land one attack (to take it off of sturdy), probably aerial ace. crustle dies then send in sandile to use torment on sawk. sandile dies then use cobalion with substitute, protect and work up. work up x4 and make sure there's a substitute up after you kill the sawk. 2hko the conk, then use protect on the mienshao. switch in durant and use protect and now you win lol. nice jump kick.<br><br>

        shauntal -> grimsley: terrakion lead<br>
        grimsley -> caitlin: cobalion lead, crustle silver powder and x scissor<br>
        caitlin -> marshal: amoonguss lead and protect, durant protect, cobalion protect sub work sword, terrakion bulldoze and probably not full health, crustle aerial ace<br><br>

        N- Make sure zekrom is not minus speed or attack. Lose the first battle cause dragon breath sucks. Teach zekrom rest and dragon claw instead of slash and dragon breath and give it a chesto berry. Put sandile back in the party and make sure crustle has bulldoze. Make sure durant has twave. Lead zekrom to 2hko reshiram with dragon claw (fusion flare into hyper beam probably should not kill). Vanilluxe comes in so switch in cobalion to thunder wave it. Stall out hail turns if possible at all, then kill it before hail ends preferably. Zekrom can finish it off if necessary. Archeops comes in so switch to sandile then terrakion to rock slide into sacred sword to take it out. The zoroark will take out your terrakion then switch crustle to bulldoze it. Fusion bolt should kill it at that point then klingklang will try to hyper beam you but the immediate durant switch lets you twave it. Get damage if you can then once zekrom comes back in use rest then take out the remaining pokemon with fusion bolt and dragon claw.<br>
        Ghetsis- Give zekrom a chesto berry again, give crustle rock tomb, and switch durant for virizion. Lead zekrom and take out the cofagrigus with 3 dragon claws, make sure you have above half health (roughly). Bouffalant comes out and switch to sandile then 2hko with terrakion sacred sword. Hydreigon comes out then sack terrakion to get crustle in to rock tomb. After crustle goes down, sacred sword with cobalion and then finish it off with zekrom dragon claw. Seismitoed comes out so we switch to virizion and giga drain x2. Eelektross finishes us off then we spam attacks/rest with zekrom until we win. Only worry is metal burst.

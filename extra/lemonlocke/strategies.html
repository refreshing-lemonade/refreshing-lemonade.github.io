        Most of this is just copy pasted from some notes. Forgive how rough around the edges it may be. Click the game title to
        view the full strategy for all major battles in the run. This page contains spoilers for the strategy, so avoid
        this page if you want to figure out the recommended Pokemon catches for yourself.

        However, this Lemonlocke is impossible due to the limited amount of Pokemon catchable in the first few areas.
        Rather, it's not possible to have a consistent strategy within the first gym. There are no Normal resists catchable
        and there are no supereffective moves that can be obtained. Riolu has the highest base stat total and level
        in the available areas, and one would think that Counter would be a possible way to beat the gym. While that is true,
        there is no feasible way to use counter multiple times, and the extra Pokemon on Cheren's team means that the battle becomes
        a 4v3 as opposed to a 4v2 in Normal Mode. As for items, Oran Berries are not enough to save the team from the sheer power of
        Normal type attacks, and Lillipup's Pickup ability does not give anything useful either (Rare Candies are banned/unobtainable
        and the Sun Stone is not available at its current level to evolve Sunkern). Riolu is a friendship evolution, but since there
        are no Rare Candies to level up at all, the Lucario in Gym 1 dream is dead. Even though there is a Rare Candy on Route 20,
        it requires Surf and is in an area that is blocked off by the Hiker on the staircase. None of the other available items,
        abilities, or Pokemon are very useful. Dream Radar would make this run possible, but this is banned under the normal rules.

    <p style="border-color: lavender">
        Ruleset:<br>
        1. Ingame timer is set to 5 minutes.<br>
        2. Pausing is not allowed, offender forfeits game (This can be easily avoided by not assigning start to an input).<br>
        3. In the event of a draw, the players will fight out the next stock ONLY to determine the winner of the game, resetting the emulation when a stock has been taken.<br>
        4. Jumping backwards, walking backwards, or crouch walking forwards for upwards of 5 seconds (or if this occurs multiple times throughout a match in shorter intervals) is stalling, and will cause the offender to lose the game if the TO deems the offender to be avoiding interaction.<br>
        <br><b>Rules 5-9 are anti-infinite rules that standardize infinites to 1 rep for all relevant characters, as well as creating a meta free of over-centralizing infinites.</b><br>
        5. Gaian may not throw an opponent after getting a knockdown from a throw.<br>
        6. Wai may not throw an opponent after getting a knockdown from a throw. After a throw, Wai's next attack cannot be a jump kick.<br>
        7. Legend may not use a knee attack to cross up an opponent more than once.<br>
        8. Kaen (Blaze) may not use Rbow Tackle to cross up an opponent more than once.<br>
        9. If an opponent blocks a jump attack from Ashura after being thrown, Ashura's next move cannot be a throw.<br>
        10. Rules 5-9 are not to be considered if the opponent is stunned or if the opponent blocks/gets hit by another attack. Offender loses game if these rules are broken.<br>
        11. Turbo controllers, macros (including A+B), bots, etc. are all banned for obvious reasons.<br>
        12. Holding right and left at the same time is banned.<br>
        13. The winner of a game picks their character first for the next game.<br>
        14. If players wish to occupy the same port, they must coinflip for the port before a set begins.<br>
        15. If the ingame timer continues to run after it has reached 0, winner is still determined by remaining health and lives; do not continue the fight (This happens in rare circumstances after a stock has been taken).<br>
        16. If a connection is unplayable, be understanding for the other player's sake, but the set will be determined by coinflip if both players have done what they can to ensure a stable connection.

        <b>Tournament Values</b><br><br>
        With the release of Community Edition, the rules would need to shift accordingly to fit the new standard mod.
        Clear the Skies aims to be the first official testing ground for competitive Joy Mech Fight under Community Edition.
        The notable differences from the Jibber's Cribb ruleset includes the standardization of relevant infinites in the meta.
        Legend is hit by this change worse than the rest but it is necessary to keep the rules
        consistent and understandable for all players.
        This was mainly done to ensure that Gaian cannot avoid the infinite limit in practice when fighting characters of average stun and below
        (which includes much of the cast). New infinite bans from Wai and Ashura are likewise made
        to ensure that neither of these already strong characters can one touch a huge portion of the cast off of a throw.<br><br>
        "Crushless Houou" is effectively introduced into the meta as a new character, one focused more on zoning and high damage
        punishes rather than jetting around the screen with the largely uncontestable Houou Crush. Houou keeps his throw infinite
        in this ruleset, as his neutral is hindered by the lack of his fast approach option.
        In contrast to the other characters with throw infinites, Houou has no real gameplan up close and is drastically less
        mobile/versatile than Wai and Ashura, and critically rarely gets knockdowns that lead to close up pressure afterwards.
        Overall he is now a character who has to
        focus on using his projectile and powerful but extremely negative normals for neutral until he can get in close.<br>
        The decision to allow Crushless Houou into the ruleset has been a difficult one, and despite shaking the foundations
        of the character's neutral, Crushless Houou is allowed to give the character more depth in its gameplan instead of
        keeping it banned. Throwless Houou was also considered an option but the same issue would arise in that Houou's
        neutral would be shallow and over-reliant on debatably the best special move in the entire game.<br><br>
        The ruleset for tournaments run with Community Edition is meant to be easily customizable, so be aware that
        Clear the Skies aims to be the best experience for future competition in Joy Mech Fight, but not necessarily the
        only type of ruleset that should be tested.

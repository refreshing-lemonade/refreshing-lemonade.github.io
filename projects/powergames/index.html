        Powergames are a series of games which use only mouse controls.
        RL created Powergames using Apache OpenOffice Impress, a free presentation software. The catalog is listed below, in alphabetical order.
        These games have been preserved unedited for years, with the only changes being to remove RL's last name when used.

            <td>COOL NINJA GAME</td>
            <td>The only platformer out of the Powergames. Very linear in terms of progression and somewhat acts as a puzzle game more so than a platformer due to the lack of a physics engine.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Don't Touch the Lava</td>
            <td>One of the first and most popular Powergames, with it being a top down precision game to guide the player's mouse across objects and avoid touching the lava.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>EASIEST GAME EVER</td>
            <td>Probably the most popular Powergame during its time. This is a quiz game loosely based off of The Impossible Quiz by Splapp-me-do and The Unbeatable Quiz (<a>Notegame</a>). Includes mostly video game related content that RL was interested in.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>EASIEST GAME EVER 2</td>
            <td>A sequel to EASIEST GAME EVER which follows much of a similar formula, even down to individual levels.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>EASIEST GEMA EVER</td>
            <td>Pretty much a rerelease of EASIEST GAME EVER with an easter egg included. Some text is misspelled purposely to give off a mysterious aura.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Meine Life</td>
            <td>A simulation game similar to Tomodachi Life (which came out around the time of this game) and like all Powergames, is quite linear. The word "Meine" is possibly of German origin, but at this point it is uncertain. Canonically and historically pronounced like "Main Life".</td>

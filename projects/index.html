                A kaizo mod for Mega Man that was tested and completed only using savestates. It's RL's oldest hack and was created using level editing utilities for the game. The game was not made with human limits in mind.

                Movement mod loosely based on Rockman 4 Burst Chaser. Mega Man has a higher jump and a faster movement speed enabling you to breeze through levels much faster. Speedruns of the mod are generally fun as well since that's what was in mind when the mod was created. Nothing else was changed other than movement.

                Rockman 2 but kaizo. Same idea as the prequel, Kaizo Man. No ASM was used to create this so it's just a nice level rearrangement that's also not made with human capabilities in mind. Arguably less brutal than the original Kaizo Man.

            <td class="tabelleZXdesc">
                A mod of Super Mario Kart with level design roughly based off of Mega Man Battle and Chase. It's rather fun if not a little bit unfaithful to the source material, as it still contains Mario Kart front to back. All of the tracks in the game have been redone including Battle Mode, so it can be considered a full game. Characters have also been arbitrarily rebalanced.

                A mod that doesn't take itself very seriously, to the point where RL assumed the emphasis in "Balanced" would be implied as a joke. It's an unbalanced mod akin to Brawl-. Movement and combo game are the main things that have been increased, as well as recovery. Pretty fun to play with friends every now and then. Patch includes the 20xx hackpack at the download page but original character files are available at the gold link.

                A mod that purely aims to rebalance the game by doing small adjustments to keep characters very in line with their original intent while making them more playable. Few special moves have been drastically changed, but the problem areas of the worse characters have been noticeably changed. A little bit out of date, as some of the higher characters were also changed a bit, when the goal was to only change the weak characters. Give it a try. Patch includes the 20xx hackpack at the download page but original character files are available at the gold link.

                A wonderfully crafted mod of Project M which adds new moves to every character, changes how moves function, and overall create a fun and hilarious mod. The custom moves and the near universal increase in the number of jumps makes for a free flow experience. Over time there has been many updates and balance patches but the game has always been fun. It's one of the top mods on gamebanana, and it's highly worth playing.
                The installation guide is available at the link for the download.

                The full title for this hack is "Webslinger's New Lava Fish Castle + Mega Fan's Tower of Pain", and yes, there will be an update that adds even more letters, some completely unnecessary. The mod is originally based off a handful of Mario Maker levels that RL and Manmanboy created. There are 26 levels between the two games, spanning Worlds 1-4. MFTOP is in world 3-4 and can be accessed via the pipe at the start of the first level. Every level has 3 star coins, and some parts of the map may be blocked off because world map editing wasn't on the radar at that point in time. The difficulty of this hack is higher than a traditional rom hack but it's more focused on challenge and precision rather than things being unfair/cheap. Some changes to the levels have even been made to make them more fair, something that RL doesn't often do once a hack is released.
                Apply to New Super Mario Bros. (USA) for Nintendo DS.

                The melee mod where RL never got to show what the 'RG' was supposed to mean. It notoriously was patched incorrectly when first released so it was a monumental pain to get running, as many users ran into an error in xdelta, which has now been addressed and fixed in a recent update. Anyway, it's a mod for Smash Bros Melee where the system and stagelist have been reworked to HEAVILY favor Stamina mode as the main game mode. By some stroke of luck, it's been supported by top melee players Essy, Polish, and Khryke <a id="linktype" href="https://twitter.com/bekvin_/status/1563011907279196161?s=20&t=ps0xkLRAjlpRujFKdh8lbA">(see reference)</a>.

                A deprecated training mod for Joy Mech Fight that has been eclipsed by ShenScript and JMF CE. Auto unlocks characters. This was the tournament standard used sometimes if vanilla wasn't preferred. Later versions were notably buggy and had incomplete features. Using certain versions in ShenScript may be preferred but it's honestly better to switch over to CE at this point.

RenDev is credited wherever this project is released as he helped RL greatly in getting the project to where it was aimed. This fighting game is inspired by the Mega Man Power Battle/Fighters games for the arcade, which were multiplayer but sadly not 1v1. No future updates are currently planned, however you can experience the game's past releases. No source code released as of yet. You can run this game by loading it in Dolphin or putting the folder in the apps folder of your SD card to play on a homebrewed Wii. Supports Gamecube controllers and Wii remotes.</td>

                Commonly referred to as CE, this mod is tournament standard for Joy Mech Fight as of 2022. Most changes in this mod can be modified in some way to allow for tournament ruleset flexability. 5 minute timer, P2 change CSS and Leo removed, menu cursor auto hovers on P1 vs P2, anti-epilepsy patch for the intro cutscene, and Houou had a special removed. Move and character names have also been changed to be more accurate to the original Japanese names while still tying in the English-speaking community.

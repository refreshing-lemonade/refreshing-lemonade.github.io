    <p style="border-color: forestgreen">
        This site was originally created in 2021 by refreshing_lemonade as a way to learn the html language and to have a better,
        more personalized central hub for personal projects.

        Not what you're looking for? Maybe try
        <a id="linktype" href="https://weaponselect.weebly.com"><b>my old site</b></a>
        until this one is more up to date.
    </p>
    <p style="border-color:chocolate">
        <b>Recently updated:</b> New backgrounds added, header brought to you by javascript, twitch link added in <b>About</b>.
        A link to the RUT discord got added too but that section will be changed sometime later.
        Also I put bold text in this section.
